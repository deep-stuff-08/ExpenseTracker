# ExpenseTracker

TODOs:

Add an option to edit entries. A button is added but not very functional as, user may have multiple entires selected and edited multiple entries one after the other is infeasible

The names on the transfer tab are reversed

No way to view or see transfers

When the AddEntryFragment is created it always shows income tab but the contents are of the expense tab
